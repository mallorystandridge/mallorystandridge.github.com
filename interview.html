			<h3>HTML Questions</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>What does a doctype do?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p>Specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.</p>
				 </div>
					
				<li>What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p>There where legacy sites that existed before the W3C standards, quirks mode was used to keep old sites from breaking in newer browsers. </p>
				</div>
				
				<li>Are there any problems with serving pages as application/xhtml+xml?</li>
				<div class="asn">  </div>
				
				<li>How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p>Your browser is configured to send accept-language headers, the web server can use those to determine your preferred language and send the appropriate document. Its it's called content negotiation</p>
				</div>
				
				<li>What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<ol>
						<li>text direction</li>
						<li>bi-directional text</li>
						<li>different numbering systems</li>
						<li>sorting alphabetically</li>
						<li>how colors are perceived across different cultures</li>
					</ol>
					<p>You can see a lot more here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" target="_blank"> https://en.wikipedia.org/</a></p>
				</div>
					
				<li>What are data-attributes good for?</li>

					<p>They are pretty good for adding extra information to an element say like for js hooks that have no visual representation.</p>
				</div>

						<li>< aside ></li>

						<li>new form elements like datepicker</li>
						<li>audio</li>
						<li>video</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				
				<li>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.</li>
				<div class="asn">

					<p><strong>sessionStorage- </strong> only works with js, ends when ever the user close the tab.</p>
					<p><strong>localStorage-  </strong> only works with js, the user has to clear localStorage.</p>
				</div>
				
				<li>Describe the difference between < script >, < script async > and < script defer >.</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p><strong> < script >- </strong> blocks the html parser while the script downloads and executes  </p>
					<p><strong> < script async >- </strong> downloads without stoping the parser, but it does stop the parser when its finished downloading so it can run. Risking blocking rendering. </p>
					<p><strong>< script defer >-  </strong> doesn't run till all of the html is parsed and rendered.</p>
				</div>
				
				<li>Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between < head>< /head> and JS < script>s just before < /body >? Do you know any exceptions?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p>You would general want the layout with the css to render first and then js. If the js is in the header the user would have to wait for the js to fully load before rendering the layout.</p>
				</div>
				
				<li>What is progressive rendering?</li>
				<div class="asn">
					<p>Instead of giving the user a whole page at once, progressive rendering- renders sections of the content at a time.</p>

				<div class="asn">
					<p>I have use markdown</p>
